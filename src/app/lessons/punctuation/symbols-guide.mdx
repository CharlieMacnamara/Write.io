# Essential Punctuation Symbols Guide

Welcome to your comprehensive guide to punctuation symbols. This lesson will help you master the most important punctuation marks through examples and interactive exercises.

## The Semicolon (;)

The semicolon is used to connect related independent clauses and separate complex list items.

<RuleExample>
  <Wrong>I love writing, it helps me express myself.</Wrong>
  <Right>I love writing; it helps me express myself.</Right>
  <Explanation>
    Use a semicolon to join two related independent clauses without a coordinating conjunction.
  </Explanation>
</RuleExample>

### Practice Time

<TextPractice
  original="The meeting was productive we covered all topics The team agreed on the timeline the project will start next week"
  rules={["semicolon"]}
  wordLimit={30}
  hint="Add semicolons where independent clauses meet"
/>

## The Em Dash (—)

The em dash is used for strong breaks in sentence structure and emphasizing content.

<RuleExample>
  <Wrong>My three favorite activities reading, writing, and coding are all sedentary.</Wrong>
  <Right>My three favorite activities—reading, writing, and coding—are all sedentary.</Right>
  <Explanation>
    Em dashes can set off parenthetical elements more emphatically than commas.
  </Explanation>
</RuleExample>

<MultipleChoice
  question="Which sentence correctly uses the em dash?"
  options={[
    "Everything I own—my books, my laptop, my notes—was in that bag.",
    "Everything I own - my books, my laptop, my notes - was in that bag.",
    "Everything I own -- my books, my laptop, my notes -- was in that bag.",
    "Everything I own...my books, my laptop, my notes...was in that bag."
  ]}
  correct={0}
  explanation="Em dashes should be used without spaces on either side, and should be true em dashes (—) rather than hyphens (-) or double hyphens (--)."
